**Plan Start:** October 20, 2025
**Current Week:** Week 3 of Phase 1
**Last Updated:** November 3, 2025

---

## Goal

Progress from current 10:00-11:00/mile easy pace to sustained 8:34/mile pace (7 mph) for 5K, then extend to 7-10 mile long runs at comfortable pace.

---

## Current State

### Weekly Volume (Last 8 Weeks)
- **May 2025:** 52.8 miles (9 runs, 9:58 avg pace)

- **Previous Peak Training:** 15-25 mpw with structured speed work
- **Recent Gap:** Inconsistent training June-September 2025 (4-9 runs/month)
- **Fitness Context:** Coming back from reduced volume, rebuilding consistency

### Current Status
- **Age:** 30
- **Cross-Training:** Strength training 2-3×/week (45-60 min sessions), cycling 1-2×/week
- **Schedule Pattern:** Running 5-6 days/week currently (more than plan prescribes)

---

## General Philosophy

**80/20 Rule:** 80% of miles should be easy, even as speed work is added. Easy runs build the aerobic base that makes fast running sustainable.

**Build Slowly:** Coming back from reduced volume means prioritizing consistency and injury prevention over speed gains. The aerobic base must be rebuilt before intensity increases.

---

## Phase 1: Base Rebuilding (Weeks 1-8)

**Status:** Currently in Week 3
**Actual Performance:** Running higher volume (15 mpw) and faster pace (9:55-10:00 on short runs) than prescribed

### Primary Goals

- Rebuild aerobic base to 15-18 mpw
- Control HR during runs (stay in 140-150 zone, no spikes)
- Build musculoskeletal resilience after inconsistent training
- Establish consistent 3×/week running routine
- Run easy pace at truly easy effort (10:45-11:15/mile)

### Weekly Structure

**Monday:** Strength Training (45-60 min)
- Lower body + core focus
- Moderate intensity - don't create excessive soreness

**Tuesday:** Easy Run
- Distance: 3-4 miles
- Pace: 10:45-11:15/mile
- HR: 140-150 bpm
- Effort: Conversational entire time
- **Note:** If HR exceeds 150, slow down immediately

**Wednesday:** Rest or light cross-training (cycling, walking)

**Thursday:** Easy Run
- Distance: 3-4 miles
- Pace: 10:45-11:15/mile
- HR: 140-150 bpm
- Effort: Conversational entire time

**Friday:** Strength Training (45-60 min)
- Upper body + core focus

**Saturday:** Long Run
- **Week 1-2:** 5 miles
- **Week 3-4:** 6 miles
- **Week 5-6:** 7 miles
- **Week 7-8:** 8 miles
- Pace: 11:00-11:30/mile (slower than easy runs)
- HR: 135-145 bpm
- Effort: Very comfortable, could go much longer

**Sunday:** Rest

**Weekly Total:**
- Weeks 1-2: 11-13 miles
- Weeks 3-4: 13-15 miles
- Weeks 5-6: 15-17 miles
- Weeks 7-8: 16-18 miles

### Adjustments Based on Actual Training

**You are currently:**
- Running 15+ mpw (Week 5-6 volume in Week 1-2)
- Running 9:55-10:00 pace on short runs (45-75 seconds too fast)
- Running 5-6 days/week (instead of 3 days)
- Averaging HR 148-155 (upper end of zone or above)
- Max HR spiking to 170-181 (significantly above target)

**Required Corrections for Week 3:**
1. **Reduce frequency:** Only run Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday this week
2. **Slow down:** Target 11:00/mile minimum, even if it feels too slow
3. **Control HR:** Walk breaks if HR exceeds 150 bpm
4. **Long run:** 6 miles at 11:15-11:30 pace (not 8+ miles)
5. **Rest days:** Actually rest on Sun, Mon, Wed, Fri (running is not allowed)

### Success Metrics

By Week 8 you should be able to:
- Run 4 miles continuously at 10:45-11:00 pace without breaks
- Maintain HR in 140-150 range without spikes above 160
- Feel recovered between runs (legs not heavy)
- Notice improved efficiency (same HR, naturally faster pace)
- Complete 8-mile long run at 11:00 pace feeling strong

### What NOT to Do

- ❌ No pickups, strides, or tempo efforts
- ❌ No testing your fitness or pushing pace
- ❌ No running with faster partners who pull you off pace
- ❌ No running on rest days "because you feel good"
- ❌ No adding extra miles beyond prescribed distances

## Pace Reference Chart

| Workout Type | Pace | HR | Effort Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Easy/Recovery | 10:45-11:15 | 140-150 | Conversational, could run much longer |
| Long Run | 11:00-11:30 | 135-145 | Very comfortable |
| Tempo/Threshold | 8:45-9:15 | 155-165 | Comfortably hard, few words only |
| Goal Pace | 8:34 | 160-170 | Hard but sustainable |
| Intervals (400m-800m) | 8:00-8:30 | 165-175 | Hard, controlled breathing |
| Strides | 7:30-7:45 | 170+ | 15-20 sec, 85-90% effort |

**Note:** Your historical 5K PR pace of 8:43/mile shows you have the fitness capability to achieve 8:34 pace with proper training progression.

## Strength Training Guidelines

### Phase 1 (Weeks 1-8): 2×/week
- **Focus:** Lower body strength, core stability, hip/glute activation
- **Exercises:** Squats, lunges, single-leg work (step-ups, split squats, single-leg deadlifts), core planks/anti-rotation
- **Intensity:** Moderate - don't create soreness that compromises runs
- **Timing:** Non-running days or after easy runs (never before runs)

### Phase 2-3 (Weeks 9-24): 1-2×/week
- **Focus:** Maintenance and injury prevention
- **Key Principle:** Single-leg exercises are critical for runners
- **Avoid:** Heavy lower body lifting day before speed workouts or long runs
- **Note:** Speed work itself becomes neuromuscular training

---

## Critical Reminders

### Easy Runs Are Non-Negotiable
- If HR hits 155+ at 10:45 pace → slow to 11:00-11:30 pace
- Walk if needed to keep HR controlled
- Easy runs build the aerobic base that makes speed sustainable
- **Never skip easy days or turn them into tempo runs**

### Listen to Your Body
- HR is a guide, not absolute law
- Some days you'll feel off (stress, hydration, sleep, fatigue)
- When in doubt, go slower
- Missing one workout is better than forcing through and getting injured

### Progression Isn't Linear
- Some weeks will feel strong, others will be hard
- This is normal, especially rebuilding from reduced volume
- Trust the process, don't panic over one bad run
- Fitness is built over months, not days

### The Long Run Is Sacred
- Long runs build endurance to make goal pace sustainable
- Don't skip it for speed work
- Often the most important workout of the week
- Keep it SLOW (11:00-11:30 pace in Phase 1)

### Recovery Is Training
- Rest days allow adaptations to happen
- Sleep 7-9 hours per night
- Hydration and nutrition matter
- Foam rolling, stretching, mobility work pay dividends

---

## Progress Tracking

### Weekly Check-ins
- Track actual pace, HR, and perceived effort for each run
- Note any aches/pains or unusual fatigue
- Adjust next week if patterns emerge (consistently too hard, too easy)

### Monthly Milestones

**End of Month 1 (Week 4 - Nov 17):**
- Can you run 4 miles continuously at 10:45-11:00 pace with controlled HR?
- Is your HR staying in 140-150 zone without spikes?
- Do you feel recovered between runs?

**End of Month 2 (Week 8 - Dec 15):**
- Can you complete 8-mile long run at 11:00 pace feeling strong?
- Has your easy pace naturally improved while keeping same HR?
- Are you ready to add structured speed work?

**End of Month 4 (Week 16 - Feb 8):**
- How do tempo runs at 9:00 pace feel? Sustainable for 2-3 miles?
- What's your estimated current 5K pace based on workouts?

**End of Month 6 (Week 24 - April 5):**
- Time trial or race at goal pace - can you sustain 8:34 for 3+ miles?
- What's your actual 5K time?

### Signs You're On Track
- Easy pace feels easier over time at same HR
- HR stays lower at same pace (improved efficiency)
- Recovery between workouts improves
- Confidence grows during speed sessions
- Long runs feel strong, not depleting
- No persistent aches or pains

### Red Flags to Watch
- Persistently elevated HR at easy paces
- Constant fatigue or heavy legs
- Loss of motivation or burnout
- Aches/pains that don't resolve with rest
- Performance declining instead of improving
- Increased resting heart rate (measure on waking)

**If you see red flags:** Take 3-5 days completely off, reassess, and potentially extend the current phase before progressing.
