## Exercise Execution Tips

**Bulgarian Split Squats:** Back foot elevated on bench, front foot far enough forward that knee tracks over ankle (not past toes). Lower until back knee nearly touches ground.

**Cable Pull-Throughs:** Face away from cable, rope between legs. Hip hinge pattern - push hips back, feel stretch in hamstrings, drive hips forward explosively using glutes.

**Single-Leg Deadlifts:** Slight bend in standing leg, hinge at hip while extending free leg behind for balance. Keep back flat, lower dumbbell to mid-shin.

**Cable Pallof Press:** Stand perpendicular to cable at chest height. Hold handle at chest, press straight out while resisting rotation. Return to chest with control.

**Lateral Band Walks:** Band around ankles or just above knees. Quarter squat position, step laterally maintaining tension. Keep toes forward, don't let knees collapse inward.

**Cable Face Pulls:** High cable position, rope attachment. Pull to face level, elbows high and wide. Squeeze shoulder blades together at end.

**Cable Woodchops:** High-to-low or low-to-high diagonal movement. Rotate through core, not just arms. Control the eccentric (return) phase.

**Cable Anti-Rotation Hold:** Arms fully extended at chest height holding cable handle. Stand perpendicular to machine. Resist rotation - maintain position for 30s each side.

**Standing Calf Raises:** Full range of motion - deep stretch at bottom, explosive push to full toe extension at top. Pause 1s at top.

**Single-Leg Calf Raises:** Bodyweight only. Use wall or support for balance. Focus on control and full range of motion.

**Goblet Squats:** Hold dumbbell vertically at chest. Squat deep, elbows track inside knees. Keep chest up and core engaged.

**Romanian Deadlifts:** Dumbbells in front of thighs. Hip hinge pattern with slight knee bend. Lower until stretch in hamstrings, drive through heels to stand.

**Reverse Lunges:** Step backward into lunge. Front knee tracks over ankle. Push through front heel to return to standing.
