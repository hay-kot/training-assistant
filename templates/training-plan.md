# Training Plan Schema

## Goal

Clear, specific objective statement describing the target outcome.

**Format:** Progress from [current performance] to [target performance] for [distance/event].

**Example:** Progress from current 10:00/mile pace to sustained 8:34/mile pace for 5K, then extend to 7-10 mile long runs.

## Current State

Data-driven assessment from Strava database and user input:

- **Weekly Volume:** [from last 4-8 weeks of Activity table]
- **Weekly Schedule:** [typical frequency and distances]
- **Current Fitness:** [pace/power/HR from recent activities]
- **Historical Best:** [from ActivityBestEffort or past Activity records]
- **Recent Gaps:** [time since last consistent training]
- **Age:** [user provided]
- **Additional Training:** [strength training, cross-training frequency]

## General Philosophy

Brief statement of core training principles guiding the plan.

**Example:**
**80/20 Rule:** 80% of miles should be easy, even as speed work is added. Easy runs build the aerobic base that makes fast running sustainable.
